I am Ph.D. Candidate in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of [Kai Yu](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/members/kai_yu) and [Yanmin Qian](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yanmin_qian). My research interests include deep learning based approaches for speaker recognition, speaker diarization and voice activity detection.
